BoomHash - is a python script which uses several online hash crackers to find the clear Text of any hash.<br>
You may have asked yourself, "How do hackers take my password, if the website owner can't?" The answer is simple. When a website stores your login password for the site, it is run through a cryptographic hash function before it enters the database, 
this script can destroy any hash ! see the Features bellow !!

Features of Boom-Boom:
- [x] Detects hash
- [x] MD5 Support
- [x] SHA1 Support
- [x] SHA2 Support
- [x] Adding more APIs for SHA1 and SHA2
- [ ] Support for more hashes will be added on request

## Installing and Using Boomhash
Open your terminal and enter :
```
git clone https://github.com/Bangnaga1/Boomhash
```
Now enter the following command :
```
cd Boomhash
```
Now run BoomHash Script by entering :

### Contribute
There isn't much to contribute but you can add support for more hashes and can add more APIs for SHA-1 and SHA-2.
## Finish
I would gladly take any ways to improve in both my how-to's and my coding. Finally, feel free to test this code out :D
